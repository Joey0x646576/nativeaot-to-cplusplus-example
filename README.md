With the release of .NET 7, a new and exciting feature has been introduced - the Native AOT (Ahead of Time). This feature involves compiling an application's code into native machine code before it's executed. That is quite the difference from regular .NET compiled code!


One of the great advantages of using Native AOT in C++ is the ability to leverage the functionality written in C#. For example, with the use of System.Text.Json, developers can easily serialize and deserialize data in their C++ applications. In this tutorial, we will walk through a simple example of how to use this powerful feature to enhance the functionality of your C++ applications.
